Marketing campaigns are usually directed at a specific promotion, because you can publish activities within a set timeframe. For example, you might run a Facebook ad to promote a sale on a product, or you might create a post on a social media platform to let your followers know about a new product. When you create a marketing activity in Shopify, you have the option to save it as a draft and publish it when it's ready, so that you can prepare your marketing activities in advance. For important events, such as Black Friday, you can group marketing activities together to work toward a specific campaign objective.
