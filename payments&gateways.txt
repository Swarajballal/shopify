general settings --> payments in which we can select INR or any other currency acceptance
Adding any third party payment provider
Bogus gateway is for testing purpose and we can select any other third party payment gateway for international payment we use paypal
Manual payment method cash on delivery and other options etc

Payments could be automatic capture or manual, manual means if at small scale we have limited stock so if we are out of stock and customer purchases a order in manual we can keep that on hold.
